Deliciousync is a utility that periodically synchronizes Safari's bookmarks
with bookmarks from a Delicious account.

Uninstallation
==============

To uninstall, delete:

1. the Deliciousync application bundle,
2. the folder ~/Library/Application Support/Deliciousync, and
3. the file ~/Library/LaunchAgents/DeliciousyncAgent.plist.

Details
=======

The Deliciousync application bundle includes a command-line tool that does the
actual work of synchronization (DeliciousyncAgent). The GUI is a front-end for
the agent, which may be used independently.

When opened, Deliciousync copies the agent and associated files to the
following directory:

~/Library/Application Support/Deliciousync

Deliciousync also creates a launchd configuration file that periodically
launches the agent:

~/Library/LaunchAgents/DeliciousyncAgent.plist

This lets launchd locate and launch the agent, even if the Deliciousync bundle
is moved or deleted.

The agent uses Sync Services to synchronize with Safari and the api.del.icio.us HTTP API to synchronize with Delicious.  In the Application Support folder,
the agent maintains a cache of Safari and Delicious bookmarks.  This cache lets
the agent sync incrementally.
